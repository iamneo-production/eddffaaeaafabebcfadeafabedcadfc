    <ul id="stepForVegetableSalad">
        <li>While my mix of juicy tomatoes, sweet carrots, cooling cucumber, crunchy celery, creamy avocado, sweet bell peppers and piquant onions is healthy, there are plenty of ways to customize this mixed veg salad to your liking. </li>
        <li>Try adding blanched, lightly steamed or roasted veggies like broccoli, french beans, corn, cauliflower, baby corn.</li>
        <li>Add lentils, beans or chickpeas or bean sprouts for more protein</li>
        <li>Grate some of the vegetables for a different texture.</li>
        <li>Add marinated veggies like artichoke hearts for tang, or other veggies like radish for some pungency.</li>
        <li>Swap in your own favorite combination of dried fruits, nuts and seeds. I added what I had at home.</li>
        <li>Use fresh coriander or chives instead of parsley.</li>
